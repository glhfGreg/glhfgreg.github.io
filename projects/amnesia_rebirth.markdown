        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Amnesia: Rebirth is a first person horror adventure set in the Algerian desert. Avoid darkness, hide from
            monsters and solve puzzles.</p>
        <p>On this project I was <b>responsible for 6 main levels of the game</b>. I was part of concepting and then
            tasked with bringing those concepts to a final shippable version. This involved working with a
            multidisciplinary team of artists, animators, sound designers and programmers to make sure all parts of the
            level adhere to the original vision. A big part of the process was <b>maintaining the tone and feel of the
                level on a holistic level</b>, without getting fixiated on mechanics and other details. <b>My personal
                highlight</b> was creating the Living Quarters level, which can be seen in this <b><a
                    href="https://youtu.be/EisP3UQXx8o">playthough video</a></b>.</p>
        <p>I designed and programmed <b>two main enemies in the game</b>: the ghoul and the wraith. The ghoul is a
            predator that hides in the dark and hunts the player using scent, while the wraith is a guardian that uses
            its light beam to pin down the player. The player is required to use different problem solving skills to
            make it past these enemies.</p>
        <p>I designed and implemented <b>the fear system, the central mechanic of the game</b>. It represents Tasi's
            (the
            protagonist) mental state which needs to be maintained by the player. Staying in the dark, witnessing
            distubring events, being attacked by monsters increases Tasi's fear and leaves her with permanent effects
            that change the course of the game.</p>
        <p>Additional contributions include systems design and programming.</p>
