        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Amnesia: Rebirth is a first person horror adventure set in the Algerian desert. Avoid darkness, hide from monsters and solve puzzles.</p>
        <p>On this project I was responsible for 6 main levels of the game. I was part of concepting and then tasked with bringing those concepts to a final shippable version. This involved working with a multidisciplinary team of artists, animators, sound designers and programmers to make sure all parts of the level adhere to the original vision. A big part of the process was maintaining the tone and feel of the level on a higher level, without getting fixiated on mechanics and other details. My personal highlight was creating the Living Quarters level, which can be seen in this <a href="https://youtu.be/q0P9Hk16M4w">playthough</a>.</p>
        <p>I also designed and programmed two main enemies in the game: the ghoul and the wraith. The ghoul is a predator that hides in the dark and hunts the player using scent, while the wraith is a guardian that uses it's ligth beam to pin down the player. The player is required to use different problem solving skills to make it past these enemies.</p>
        <p>Additional contributions include systems design and programming.</p>
